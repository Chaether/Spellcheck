# Spellcheck

This is based on a project for an online coding course, in which the aim is to create a program 
that will check an inputted text file for misspelled words using an input of a "dictionary" 
which contains a list of acceptable words.

My current goal is to increase the speed of loading and play around with data structures to see if I can do things more efficiently.
